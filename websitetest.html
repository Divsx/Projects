<h2 id="italy">1.Italian</h2>

<p> Italian food has captivated taste buds around the world for centuries, with its zesty tomato sauces,<br>those clever things they do with wheat flour and desserts that are basically vehicles for cream.<br>

It’s all so simple. Get some noodles, get some olive oil, get some garlic, maybe a tomato or a slice of bacon.<br> Bam! You have a party on a plate. And it is all so easy to cook and eat.<br>

From the cheesy risottos to the crisp fried meats, Italian cuisine is a compendium of crowd-pleasing comfort food.<br> Many people have welcomed it into their homes, especially novice cooks.<br>Therein lies the real genius – Italian food has become everyman’s food.</p>
<h2 id="China">2.Chinese</h2>
<img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/09/chinese-food_759.jpg?w=759" alt="Chinese Food" width="600" height="200" class="centre">

<p> The people who greet each other with “Have you eaten yet?” are arguably the most food-obsessed in the world.<br> Food has been a form of escapism for the Chinese throughout its tumultuous history.<br>

The Chinese entrepreneurial spirit and appreciation for the finer points of frugality result in one of the bravest<br> tribes of eaters in the world. But the Chinese don’t just cook and sell anything, they also make it taste great.<br>

China is the place to go to get food shock a dozen times a day. “You can eat that?” will become the intrepid food traveler’s daily refrain.<br>

China’s regional cuisines are so varied it’s hard to believe they’re from the same nation. <br>It’s not a food culture you can easily summarize except to say you’ll invariably want seconds.</p>

<h2 id="France">3.French</h2>
<img src="https://happywanderer15.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1713.jpg" alt="France" width="600" height="200" class="centre">

<p>if you’re one of those people who doesn’t like to eat because “there’s more to life than food,” then visit Paris.<br> It’s a city notorious for its curmudgeonly denizens, but they all believe in the importance of good food.<br> Two-hour lunch breaks for three-course meals are de rigeur.<br>

Entire two-week vacations are centered on exploring combinations<br> of wines and cheeses around the country. Down-to-earth <br>cooking will surprise those who thought of the French as the world’s food snobs – it is the birthplace of the Michelin Guide, after all.<br>

French foods such as cassoulet, pot au feu and steak frites are revelatory when had in the right bistros.</p>

<h2 id="Spain">4.Spanish</h2>
<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.SfoNN--fhKqbtvn1AN0HZQAAAA?w=246&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7" alt="Spanish Food" width="600" height="200" class="centre">
<p>Let’s eat and drink then sleep. Then work for two hours. Then eat and drink again.

<br>Viva España, that country whose hedonistic food culture we all secretly wish was our own.
 
<br>All that bar-hopping and tapas-eating, the 9 p.m. dinners, the endless porron challenges – <br>this is a culture based on, around and sometimes even inside food.<br>

Spanish cuisine is made with the same unbridled passion you find in the flamenco dance. <br>The people munch on snacks throughout the day with intervals of big meals. From the fruits of<br> the Mediterranean Sea to the spoils of the Pyrenees,<br> 

from the saffron and cumin notes of the Moors to the insane molecular <br>experiments of Ferran Adria, Spanish food is timeless yet avant garde.</p>

<h2 id="Japan">5.Japanese</h2>
<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.ee4d0ac96e6829adc807b2fa19729eb8?rik=huSxfngwcrFhYw&riu=http%3a%2f%2ftravelsquire.com%2fts%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2016%2f12%2fTSOsechi.jpg&ehk=T0B%2bjMGdmcrYhBsZzMrnVadbo93%2fmndMqUizR9ee6Wg%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" alt="Japanese Food" width="600" height="200" class="centre">
<p>The Japanese apply the same precision to their food as they do to their engineering. <br>This is the place that spawned tyrannical sushi masters <br>and ramen bullies who make their staff and customers tremble with a glare.<br>

With Japanese food, you can get a lavish multicourse kaiseki meal that presents <br>the seasons in a spread of visual and culinary poetry. Or grab a seat at a<br> revolving sushi conveyor for a solo feast. Or pick up something random and previously <br>unknown in your gastronomic lexicon from the refrigerated shelves<br> of a convenience store. It’s impossible to eat badly in Japan.</p>
